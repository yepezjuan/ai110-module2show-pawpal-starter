# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- there is only one user for this version where, the user can have multiple pets, each pet can then have multiple tasks. where each task is categorized and given a priority order which is then used to make a task schedule for the user

- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

  Pet Class:
  Pet Task Class:
  Task Schedule Class
  Task Class

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

Yes, it did change I removed 2 functions from init design:

ScheduledTask The indirection of wrapping a PetTask with time slots is not needed yet. DailyPlan will hold an ordered list of PetTask objects directly; time display can be computed on-the-fly when rendering.
Frequency (enum) Recurring task frequency adds complexity to is_due_today() without a task history mechanism to back it. Removed entirely for v1; PetTask.is_recurring can stay as a bool if needed, but the Frequency enum is dropped.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- it can only have one user for right now
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?
- want to only make a working MVP, can extend to mulit owner later:

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

---

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
